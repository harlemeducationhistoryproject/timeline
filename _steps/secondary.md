Continuing the arts focus of one of the small schools within the larger Wadleigh campus, Wadleigh Secondary School for the Performing and Visual Arts opened in 2000. 

Frederick Douglass Academy II opened in the Wadleigh building as well. FDAII was designed on a model created by former Wadleigh teacher Lorraine Monroe.
