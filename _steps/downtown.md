New York City's first public high school for girls opened in 1897, in a building on East 12th Street in downtown Manhattan. The building had previously been the site of the "12th Street Advanced School for Girls," a private school founded by Lydia Wadleigh in 1856. In honor of Ms. Wadleigh's work in girls' education, the Board of Education of the City of New York renamed what had been called Girls High School to Wadleigh High School for Girls in 1900.
