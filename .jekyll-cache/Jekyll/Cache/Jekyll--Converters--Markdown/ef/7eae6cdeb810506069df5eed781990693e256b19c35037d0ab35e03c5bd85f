I"È<p>New York City‚Äôs first public high school for girls opened in 1897, in a building on East 12th Street in downtown Manhattan. The building had previously been the site of the ‚Äú12th Street Advanced School for Girls,‚Äù founded by Lydia Wadleigh in 1856 - at a time when New York City‚Äôs schools were formally segregated by race. Most likely, the school did not serve Black students. In honor of Ms. Wadleigh‚Äôs work in girls‚Äô education, the Board of Education of the City of New York renamed what had been called Girls High School to Wadleigh High School for Girls in 1900.</p>
